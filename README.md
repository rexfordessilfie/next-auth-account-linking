# next-auth-account-linking 
This project demonstrates an approach for supporting ["one user, multiple account providers"](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/discussions/1702#discussioncomment-5995307) with [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/).


It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, ensure that you have the necessary environment variables as listed and described in `.env.example`.

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Once the application is started, you may go to the demo and attempt the sign-in functionality! ðŸŽ‰
